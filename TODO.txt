 * Get the webrtc stuff to work reliably with the app on an actual phone.

 * Add buttons on the "Cockpit" page on the controller for selecting robot videosource, audiosource and audiooutput.

 * Add support for sending robot movement commands from the controller via the arrow keys on the keyboard and
   by holding and dragging a gui-widget. When using the arrow keys, the gui-widget should move accordingly on
   its own.
   * The commands should be sent via the datachannel twice a second (or at once when a value is changed).
   * The robot-webpage should display values of the last received movement command
   * The robol-webpage should call a method on the injected java-object (if the object is present).


 * Get the arduino ide up and running for the microcontroller.

 * Hook a battery and two lego motors up to the microcontroller. Make a sketch that make the motors run.

 * Add bluetooth support in the app and get it to connect to the microcontroller.

 * Add support for selecting multiple cameras on the robot.

 * Support for OpenId connect has been implemented, but we don't actually use it yet. We must protect
   all the urls with proper security. The robot is probably a special case, though. We have to figure
   out how to deal with that.
