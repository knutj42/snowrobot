 * Get the webrtc stuff to work reliably with the app on an actual phone.

 * Add buttons on the "Cockpit" page on the controller for selecting robot videosource, audiosource and audiooutput.

 * Add support for sending robot movement commands from the controller via the arrow keys on the keyboard.
   When using the arrow keys, the gui-widget should move accordingly on its own.
   * The robot-webpage should display values of the last received movement command

 * Add support for selecting multiple cameras on the robot.

 * Support for OpenId connect has been implemented, but we don't actually use it yet. We must protect
   all the urls with proper security. The robot is probably a special case, though. We have to figure
   out how to deal with that.
