* set up a turn server on the VPS (in docker). Check that it works to connect a phone that isn't on the wifi network.

* write a new signaling server with proper robot support. The robot should connect
  on one endpoint, and the webapp on another endpoint, so that the server knows who is who.

  Only one robot and one webapp should be allowed to connect at once. Newest connection wins (so that a reload will
  work).

  The server should support multiple different robots (maybe use a different room for each robot-name?)

  The needs to handle disconnect/reconnects and changing video sources robustly.

  Write a "robot" webapp to simulate the android app; it is much quicker to test and debug the webrtc functionality
  in a webapp first.



* use localstorage to remember the user's camera selection
